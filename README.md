# Janngi

This project is a game called Janngi, also known as Korean chess. It is most similar to Chinese chess as the rules are almost identical. For the full description of rules ![here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janggi) is a Wikipedia link that goes over how to play and shows what the board looks like. 

The game is built using python object-oriented principles and uses two different classes to implement the game. The first class, located in the GamePiece.py file, creates the game piece objects to be used by the board. The second class, located on the Janngi.py file, creates an instance of the game to be played and contains all the functions for the gameâ€™s logic.
